## Overview

`"dieroller"` is a minimal [R](http://www.r-project.org/) package 
that provides functions to simulate rolling a die.

* `die()` creates a die object (of class `"die"`)
* `roll()` tosses a coin object, producing a `"roll"` object.
* `plot()` method for a `"roll"` object to plot frequencies of heads.
* `summary()` method for a `"roll"` object.


## Motivation

This package has been developed to illustrate some of the concepts
behind the creation of an R package.


## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub via the package `"devtools"`:

```r
# development version from GitHub:
#install.packages("devtools") 

# install "cointoss" (without vignettes)
devtools::install_github("gastonstat/cointoss")

# install "cointoss" (with vignettes)
devtools::install_github("gastonstat/cointoss", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## Usage

```{r}
library(dieroller)

# default die
die1 <- die()
die1

# 1 toss of coin1
roll(die1)

# 20 tosses of coin1
roll20 <- roll(die1, times = 20)
roll20

# summary
summary(roll20)


# 100 tosses
roll100 <- roll(die1, times = 100)

# summary
summary(roll100)
```
